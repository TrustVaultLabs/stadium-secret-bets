## 🎯 What Makes Us Different?

Traditional sports betting platforms are vulnerable to manipulation and insider trading. **Stadium Secret Bets** revolutionizes the industry by using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to ensure your bets remain completely private until match completion.

### 🔐 Privacy-First Architecture
- **Encrypted Bet Placement**: Your wagers are encrypted on-chain using FHE
- **Hidden Odds**: No one can see your betting patterns or strategies
- **Fair Results**: Decryption only happens after the final whistle
- **Zero Manipulation**: Impossible to influence odds based on betting volume

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TrustVaultLabs/stadium-secret-bets.git
cd stadium-secret-bets

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLETCONNECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_KEY
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds

- **shadcn/ui** for components
- **RainbowKit** for wallet integration

### Blockchain Integration
- **Ethereum Sepolia** testnet
- **FHE Smart Contracts** for encrypted operations
- **Wagmi** for contract interactions
- **Viem** for low-level blockchain operations

### Encryption Layer
- **FHEVM** for homomorphic encryption
- **Zama Network** for FHE operations
- **Encrypted state management**

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **Connect Your Wallet**

```typescript
// Your bet amount and selection are encrypted before submission
const encryptedBet = await encryptBetData({
  matchId: 1,
  betType: 'HOME_WIN',
  amount: 100
});
```

### 3. **Watch Live Matches**

// Place an encrypted bet
function placeBet(
    uint256 _matchId,
    BetType _betType,
    externalEuint32 _amount,
    bytes calldata _amountProof
) public payable returns (uint256);

// Update match results (oracle only)
function updateMatchResult(
    uint256 _matchId,
    externalEuint32 _homeScore,
    externalEuint32 _awayScore,
    bytes calldata _scoreProof
) public onlyOracle;
